# Very Simple To Do Application
 this is a basic React application using three different methods using different components. The Main component contains state which will control the rest of the other components. The next two, the form and list are both stateless components, the form being the Class component and the List being the function. This whole React application is a great way to understand the inner workings of how a React application receives, manipulates and produces state.
